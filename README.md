This is my project done as the final assignement in Computer Science class way back in high school, now continued as I am in uni!
If you want to download it and execute it, I hope that you have some fun with it.

To play, unzip game.zip in a separate folder, and click on the .exe file to play!

Requirements for accessing the source code:\
